## Description

In this assignment, I create a HTML rendering tool that allows a user to generate a static HTML page based on their responses to the following questions: What is the name of your employee? What is the email of your employee? What is the ID of your employee? What is the role of your employee? And other questions are aked contitionally based on what role a user chooses. Unit tests are also available for the classes used in the generator.
